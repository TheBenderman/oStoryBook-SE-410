## oStoryBook Code for SE 410 - Software Project Evolution at Drexel University

In this project, I was asked to implement a change in the open source code for oStorybook. The change was to add the ability to import a text file into the project, run a natural language processor on the code, and then extract all of the different characters from the text file. Then, the characters pane of the application should be updated with the characters that were extracted from the file.
